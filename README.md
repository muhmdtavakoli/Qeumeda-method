# Qeumeda-method
We use this code for non-Newtonian fluids at nano and micro scales. These types of fluids are mostly applied in biological systems,
such as the dimensions of human and animal bodies. 
We have worked to prepare this code for your use. 
This code is based on the formulations developed by Dr. quemada https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01522036, whose paper was published in 1978
